Planned\\nobsolescence is a deliberate ef fort by companies to make their products obsolete, or unusable, after a period of\\ntime. The goal is to improve a companyâ s sales by reducing the amount of time between the repeat purchases\\nconsumers make of products. When a software developer introduces a new version of product, it is usually\\ndesigned to be incompatible with older versions of it. For example, not all the formatting features are the same\\nin Microsoft W ord 2007 and 2010. Sometimes documents do not translate properly when opened in the newer\\nversion.

These brands are also\\ndesigned to contribute to PepsiCoâ s environmental and social responsibilities.\\nPepsiCoâ s brand awareness, profitability , and strong presence in global markets are also strengths.

This helps or ganizations pursue more opportunities.\\nAlthough the brand awareness for PepsiCoâ s products is strong, smaller companies often struggle with weaknesses\\nsuch as low brand awareness, low financial reserves, and poor locations. When or ganizations assess their internal\\nenvironments, they must look at factors such as performance and costs as well as brand awareness and location.\\nManagers need to examine both the past and current strategies of their firms and determine what strategies\\nsucceeded and which ones failed. This helps a company plan its future actions and improves the odds they will\\nbe successful. For example, a company might look at packaging that worked very well for a product and use the\\nsame type of packaging for new products. Firms may also look at customersâ reactions to changes in products,\\nincluding packaging, to see what works and doesnâ t work. When PepsiCo changed the packaging of major brands\\nin 2008, customers had mixed responses.
